					<h1>Braincave HQ</h1>

						One of my first projects with the Braincave team was a meticulous digital twin of our office.
						It went through several revisions, and the final release is one of Braincave's flagship
						environments. The iteration shown here was built using Blender and Adobe's Substance Suite.

						Another digital twin, this time of the real-life Frederick, MD Visitor Center. The Braincave team
						was hired to create a virtual demo for the center to use for an anniversary celebration at the height
						of the Covid-19 pandemic. I built this space using Autodesk Maya and Adobe's Substance Suite.

				The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, branded as NCAA March Madness and commonly called March Madness, is
				a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball
				teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national
				championship. The tournament was created in 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and was the idea
				of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. Played mostly during March, it has become one of the biggest annual sporting
				events in the United States.
