				(Screenshot of the window system)
				<br><br>
				The BraincaveXR platform was intended for enterprise use and our roadmap included robust tools
				for working with data in virtual reality. Behind the scenes, this meant we had to reinvent a
				lot of wheels. Just to achieve basic functionality, we needed to implement a text system in 3D
				space, work out the sizes of that text, work out margins and padding, implement CSS-style layout
				tools, you name it. And then, on top of it all, if the scriptwriter wants to <i>do</i> anything
				with a table, they have to understand the complex system of object-space position references,
				child-parent hierarchies, and nested scale transforms that we had built.
				<br><br>
				Enter my Pane Interface system. I was responsible for building an interface component that could
				be applied to any table and bring it to life with basic functionality. Internally, we had been
				referring to tables' container objects as "panes" all along, and building a "window" system around
				these "panes" was a no-brainer. Har har. The problem was that our various use cases, and our
				sometimes-clunky scripting language, meant every pane was built differently. Simply putting controls
				inside a pane wouldn't work - some panes had strange internal rotations or non-unifom scaling and
				just didn't behave when you wanted them to.
				<br><br>
				The solution was to set my interface outside of the panes, and then marry them in world-space.
				Relying on a number of other tools I'd already built, chiefly Mesh Utils for bounding box and
				spatial math, the Pane Interface was able to reach out of its pane and inject itself into the scene
				graph at the environment level. This key innovation allows it to scale the table however it wants,
				collapse it entirely, resize itself dynamically based on bounding boxes, rotate the table cleanly,
				and generally be completely agnostic towards the individual table's internal makeup.
				<br><br>
				This was the last feature I developed before Braincave's closure. I would have liked to refine its
				appearance more, but I am proud to have built such a robust and practical tool.
