				I was commissioned to redesign <a href="http://pscdip.com">#1-3A Method Driving School</a>'s logo as
				part of an ongoing site overhaul.
				<br><br>
				After several revisions, the final version of this logo combines rendered 3D elements with traditional
				two-dimensional graphic design. We wanted to find a design that was legible at small scales (like when
				attached to the header of an email) but could still impress when viewed full-size on the business' front
				page. To this end, I designed the key visual elements with smooth gradients for visual appeal that
				doesn't become over-crowded at small scales.
				<br><br>
				It was important that this logo make the company look cool. I designed a car reminiscent of classic
				American muscle, but with sleeker curves to suggest some modernity. We don't want to get customers
				excited about breaking the rules of the road, but some curb appeal has never been bad for business.
				<br><br>
				By the way... since my web server is a little slow, you're looking at a compressed version of the
				image. If you're willing to sit through a few seconds' loading, check out the
				<a href="Images/3AMethod/3amethodlogo_fq.png">full-quality version</a> instead.
