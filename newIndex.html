				The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, branded as NCAA March Madness and commonly called March Madness, is
				a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball
				teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national
				championship. The tournament was created in 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and was the idea
				of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. Played mostly during March, it has become one of the biggest annual sporting
				events in the United States.
