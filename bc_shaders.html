				This is a lightweight, extremely performant shader that I built during my internship with the National
				Library of Medicine in 2018. It operates a little like a conventional 'matcap' shader (short for
				'material capture') which samples a pre-lit sphere based on surface normals, but splits the pre-rendered
				lighting into four channels - one each for glossy diffuse, glossy specular, rough diffuse, and rough specular.
				Like a conventional matcap, it is able to efficiently imitate an arbitrarily complex lighting setup, but it
				does so while retaining fairly robust texture options for artists.
				<br><br>
				(RGBAMix png and the split channels)
				<br><br>
				This shader is just as fast as Unity's basic 'Bumped spec 1 light' mobile shader but provides an attractive
				sylized look with the illusion of rich lighting. Unity's fully-PBR Standard Shader <i>can</i> far outperform
				my matcap shader, but it does so at a tremendous performance cost on mobile hardware.
				<br><br>
				(comparison here)
				<br><br>
				The material is simple to set up. It uses only two textures: a base map (with optional alpha roughness) and
				a tangent-space normal map. The material artist can configure colors for lights and shadows, which the shader
				interpolates between based on brightness. Lighting data, in the form of a four-channel matcap, can be either
				hand-drawn or rendered out from any 3D modeling package, requiring only a little technical know-how to set up
				the RGBA channels correctly.

				(Maybe a demonstration of the Maya->Unity lighting process?)
